      <h2>We're Proud to Announce OpenBrews!</h2>
      <p>
        OpenBrews is a free and open source application for building beer recipes.
        Alternative applications are dated, clunky, extremely limited, or commerical.
        OpenBrews leverages modern technologies and the open source community to give
        it a competitive edge. Our goal is to make an intuitive, cross-platform app
        that everyone can take advantage of at no cost whatsoever. OpenBrews is currently
        being developed for iOS and Android.
      </p>

      <h2>What About Pre-Releases on Android?</h2>
      <p>
        You heard correct! Very soon, we will release an Alpha version of our app
        for Android.

            <p>
              OpenBrews has a recipe list stored directly on your device. You don't
              have to pay for any silly cloud storage fees, and you'll always have your
              recipes even if you don't have an internet connection. This is the central
              hub of the application.
            </p>

            <h3>Local Storage</h3>
            <p>
              All of your recipes and their data will be stored locally on your device.
              This helps us keep the app free, and helps you to always retain access
              to your data.
